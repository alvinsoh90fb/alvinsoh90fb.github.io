My First App: Privacy policy
Welcome to the My First App for Android!

This is an open source Android app created following the guide here: https://developer.android.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-app#0

I programmed this app to only to test sending events via FB SDK. As such, there will be activity recorded only when the app is opened and the initial interface is loaded.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Alvin Soh
